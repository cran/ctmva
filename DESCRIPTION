Description: Implements a basis function or functional data analysis framework
             for several techniques of multivariate analysis in continuous-time 
             setting. Specifically, we introduced continuous-time analogues of
             several classical techniques of multivariate analysis, such as 
             principal component analysis, canonical correlation analysis, 
             Fisher linear discriminant analysis, K-means clustering, and so 
             on. Details are in Philip T Reiss and Biplab Paul (2022) "Continuous-time multivariate analysis";
