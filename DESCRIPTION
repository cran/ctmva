Description: Implements a basis function or functional data analysis framework
             for several techniques of multivariate analysis in continuous-time 
             setting. Specifically, we introduced continuous-time analogues of
             several classical techniques of multivariate analysis, such as 
             principal component analysis, canonical correlation analysis, 
             Fisher linear discriminant analysis, K-means clustering, and so 
             on. Details are in Biplab Paul, Philip T. Reiss and Erjia Cui (2023) 
             "Continuous-time multivariate analysis" <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2307.09404>.
